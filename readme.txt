Connection Bridge

Dear Customer,

This manual will help you install this Connection Bridge on your site in a few minutes.

How to install target bridge:

1. Upload "bridge2cart" folder from this archive to your store root directory
 Note: For Wordpress (WooCommerce, Shopp, WP e-Commerce) or Joomla (AceShop, JooCart, VirtueMart, MijoShop) e-commerce plugins the "bridge2cart" archive should be uploaded to the root directory where your CMS (Wordpress/Joomla) is installed, not your e-commerce plugin directory.

2. Set the permissions as following:

   "bridge.php" - 644 and the right file owner (the one that is the owner of other store files, for example  www-data)
   "/bridge2cart" folder - 755 and the right store directory owner (the one that is the owner of other store directories, for example  www-data)

To check if the Bridge files are working correctly, enter address line: http://[yourstore url]/bridge2cart/bridge.php in your browser.
If you see �BRIDGE INSTALLED.Version: <current bridge version>� the bridge is working correctly.
If not, please update permissions for items mentioned above once again.

NOTE!
We strongly recommend to turn off redirect on your site for proper work of the Connection Bridge files.
To check if you need to turn off redirect, follow this link "http://[yourstore url]/bridge2cart/bridge.php" and once it's
redirecting to some other link you should disable redirects in your .htaccess file.
It's a hidden file residing in your "shop" folder.
